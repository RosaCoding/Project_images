# Project_images

I am learning web developing from Free Code Camp.
Tonight I find out the project I am working on lost its images which I got from free online image website: Pixabay.
Due to some codepen issues, the image link is not working as it suppose to.

After seaching online, I find this github post: [We should warn campers that Imgur links do not work with CodePen. #5677]
They suggest to upload your images to Github and use that url in Codepen. It works!

Happy learning!
